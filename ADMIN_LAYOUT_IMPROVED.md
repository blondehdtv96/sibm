## How to Use

### For New Pages
Use the new layout by extending it:

```php
@extends('layouts.admin-modern')

@section('title', 'Your Page Title')

@section('content')
    <!-- Your content here -->
@endsection
```

### Switching Back to Old Layout
If you need to use the old layout, simply change the controller back:

```php
return view('admin.dashboard', compact('stats', 'recentNews', 'recentRegistrations'));
```
