## Usage Examples

### Using Audit Logging in Controllers:
```php
use App\Services\AuditLogService;

class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(private AuditLogService $auditLog) {}
    
    public function update(Request $request, Page $page)
    {
        $oldValues = $page->getOriginal();
        $page->update($request->validated());
        
        // Manual logging (or use Auditable trait)
        $this->auditLog->logUpdated($page, $oldValues);
    }
}
```

### Using Auditable Trait:
```php
use App\Traits\Auditable;

class Page extends Model
{
    use Auditable; // Automatically logs created, updated, deleted
}
```

### Using Secure File Storage:
```php
use App\Services\SecureFileStorageService;

class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function upload(Request $request, SecureFileStorageService $storage)
    {
        // Store image with thumbnails
        $paths = $storage->storeImage(
            $request->file('image'),
            'pages',
            ['thumbnail' => [150, 150], 'medium' => [600, 600]]
        );
        
        // Store private document
        $path = $storage->storeDocument($request->file('document'), 'ppdb');
        
        // Delete file
        $storage->delete($path, 'secure');
    }
}
```

### Viewing Audit Logs:
```php
use App\Services\AuditLogService;

// Get recent logs
$logs = $auditLog->getRecentLogs(50);

// Get user's logs
$logs = $auditLog->getUserLogs($userId, 50);

// Get model's logs
$logs = $auditLog->getModelLogs($page, 50);

// Get security logs
$logs = $auditLog->getSecurityLogs(7); // Last 7 days
```

## Database Migration Required

Run the following command to create the audit_logs table:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Scheduled Tasks

Add to `app/Console/Kernel.php` schedule method:
```php
// Clean audit logs older than 90 days (run monthly)
$schedule->command('audit:clean --days=90')->monthly();
```

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Security Settings
MAX_FILE_SIZE=2048
VIRUS_SCAN_ENABLED=false
CSP_ENABLED=true
SESSION_TIMEOUT=120
AUDIT_ENABLED=true
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **CSRF Protection**: Verify all forms have @csrf directive
2. **XSS Protection**: Test HTML content sanitization
3. **File Upload**: Test with various file types including malicious ones
4. **Audit Logging**: Verify logs are created for sensitive operations
5. **Security Monitoring**: Test with SQL injection and XSS payloads
6. **Query Optimization**: Monitor slow query logs in development

## Production Considerations

1. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate ClamAV or similar for production
2. **IP Blocking**: Implement automatic IP blocking after multiple security threats
3. **Email Alerts**: Send alerts for critical security events
4. **Log Rotation**: Set up log rotation for audit logs
5. **Performance**: Monitor audit log table size and run cleanup regularly
6. **CSP Headers**: Enable Content Security Policy headers
7. **Rate Limiting**: Configure rate limiting for login and registration

## Security Checklist

## Next Steps

1. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
2. Test file uploads with security validation
3. Verify audit logs are being created
4. Monitor security logs for threats
5. Configure virus scanning if needed
6. Set up scheduled task for log cleanup
7. Review and adjust security settings in config/security.php
