  - `exportStatistics()` - Main export handler
  - `exportPpdbStatistics()` - PPDB data export
  - `exportVisitorStatistics()` - Visitor data export
  - `exportUserStatistics()` - User data export
  - `exportSummaryStatistics()` - Combined summary export

## Files Created

### Controllers
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/DashboardController.php` - Main dashboard controller with statistics and export methods

### Middleware
- `app/Http/Middleware/TrackVisitor.php` - Visitor tracking middleware

### Migrations
- `database/migrations/2024_01_15_000000_create_visitor_logs_table.php` - Visitor logs table

### Views
- `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php` - Enhanced dashboard view with charts and export

## Files Modified

### Configuration
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` - Added TrackVisitor middleware to web middleware group

### Routes
- `routes/web.php` - Updated admin dashboard route to use controller, added data and export endpoints

## Key Features

### Statistics Dashboard
- **User Statistics**: Total users, breakdown by role (admin, teacher, student), recent users
- **Content Statistics**: Pages, news, competencies, gallery albums and items with published/active counts
- **PPDB Statistics**: Total registrations, status breakdown (pending, verified, rejected), daily trends
- **Visitor Analytics**: Total visitors, daily/weekly/monthly counts, popular pages

### Interactive Charts
- **PPDB Chart**: Line chart showing registration trends over last 30 days
- **Visitor Chart**: Bar chart showing unique visitor counts over last 30 days
- Both charts use Chart.js with iOS 16 styling and smooth animations

### Visitor Tracking
- Automatic tracking of public page visits
- Captures IP address, user agent, URL, referer
- Excludes admin and API routes
- Graceful failure to not disrupt user experience

### Auto-Refresh
- Toggle switch to enable/disable auto-refresh
- Refreshes dashboard every 5 minutes when enabled
- Preference saved in localStorage
- Manual refresh button with loading animation

### Export Functionality
- Export statistics as CSV files
- Multiple export types available
- Timestamped filenames
- Comprehensive data including:
  - Summary statistics across all modules
  - Detailed PPDB registration data
  - Visitor analytics and popular pages
  - User breakdown and recent registrations

### iOS 16 Design
- Gradient stat cards with custom icons
- Blur effects and rounded corners
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive grid layouts
- Color-coded status badges
- Professional typography hierarchy

## Technical Implementation

### Data Aggregation
- Efficient database queries with grouping and aggregation
- 30-day rolling window for trend analysis
- Status breakdowns for PPDB registrations
- Unique visitor counting by IP address

### Performance Considerations
- Conditional table existence checks
- Graceful degradation when features are disabled
- Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing
- Minimal data transfer for AJAX updates

### Security
- Admin middleware protection
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Sanitized data in exports
- No sensitive information exposed
