  - Previous/Next navigation buttons
  - Image counter display
  - Optional image titles
  - iOS 16 blur effects on controls
  - Backdrop blur effect
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

```

- Navigate with keyboard arrows or on-screen buttons
- Swipe left/right on mobile devices
- Press Escape to close
- Click backdrop to close
- Smooth transitions between images
- Image counter (e.g., "3 / 12")
- iOS 16-styled controls with blur effects

## Design Highlights

### iOS 16 Design Elements
1. **Card System:**
   - Rounded corners (16-20px border-radius)
   - Subtle shadows with blur
   - Hover animations with scale transforms
   - Gradient overlays

2. **Color Palette:**
   - Primary gradient: #667eea to #764ba2
   - White cards with subtle shadows
   - Semi-transparent overlays with backdrop-filter blur

3. **Typography:**
   - Clear hierarchy with varying font sizes
   - Font weights: 500-700 for emphasis
   - Secondary text in #86868b

4. **Interactions:**
   - Smooth transitions (0.3-0.4s cubic-bezier)
   - Hover effects with scale and shadow changes
   - Touch-friendly button sizes (44-56px)
   - Drag-and-drop with visual feedback

5. **Lightbox:**
   - Full-screen overlay with 95% black backdrop
   - Backdrop blur effect
   - Frosted glass controls (rgba with backdrop-filter)
   - Smooth animations (fadeIn, zoomIn)
   - Rounded buttons with hover effects

## Technical Implementation

### Image Optimization
```php
// Thumbnail generation (400x400 max)
$img->resize(400, 400, function ($constraint) {
    $constraint->aspectRatio();
    $constraint->upsize();
});
$img->save($thumbnailPath, 85);

// Original optimization (1920x1920 max)
$originalImg->resize(1920, 1920, function ($constraint) {
    $constraint->aspectRatio();
    $constraint->upsize();
});
$originalImg->save($fullPath, 90);
```

### Multiple File Upload
- Uses HTML5 multiple file input
- JavaScript FileReader API for previews
- DataTransfer API for file manipulation
- Drag-and-drop with dragover/drop events
- Individual file removal before upload

### Drag-and-Drop Sorting

- AJAX updates to save new order
- Visual feedback during drag
- Ghost element styling

### Lightbox Navigation

- Type differentiation (image/video)
- Ordered queries

## File Storage Structure
