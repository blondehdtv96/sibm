# WhatsApp 429 Error Fix

## Problem
Users were experiencing HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors when clicking the WhatsApp floating button multiple times in quick succession.

## Root Cause
The error occurs when users rapidly click the WhatsApp button, triggering multiple requests to WhatsApp's servers within a short time frame, which causes WhatsApp to rate limit the requests.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Rate Limiting
- Added a 3-second cooldown between WhatsApp button clicks
- Prevents multiple rapid clicks that could trigger rate limits

### 2. Visual Feedback
- Button becomes disabled during the cooldown period
- Loading spinner shows when button is disabled
- Warning message appears if user tries to click too quickly

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Clear visual indicators of button state
- Informative feedback messages

## Technical Changes

### Updated WhatsApp Float Component
- Added `openWhatsApp()` method with rate limiting logic
- Implemented `lastClickTime` tracking
- Added `isDisabled` state management
- Created `showRateLimitWarning()` for user feedback

### Key Features
- **Rate Limiting**: 3-second minimum interval between clicks
- **Visual States**: Disabled state with loading spinner
- **User Feedback**: Warning messages for rapid clicks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintains functionality while preventing errors

## Usage
The WhatsApp button now automatically prevents rapid clicking and provides clear feedback to users. No additional configuration is required.

## Testing
1. Click the WhatsApp button once - should work normally
2. Try clicking again immediately - should show warning message
3. Wait 3 seconds and click again - should work normally
4. Verify loading states and visual feedback work correctly

## Benefits
- Eliminates HTTP 429 errors
- Improves user experience with clear feedback
- Maintains WhatsApp functionality
- Prevents server overload from rapid requests
