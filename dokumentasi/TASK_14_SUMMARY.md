## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suite
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature

# Run specific test file
php artisan test tests/Unit/UserModelTest.php

# Run with coverage (requires Xdebug)
php artisan test --coverage
```

## Running the Seeders

```bash
# Run all seeders
php artisan db:seed

# Run specific seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder

# Fresh migration with seeding
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Default Admin Credentials

After running the seeders, you can log in with:
- **Email**: admin@school.com
- **Password**: password

## Sample Data Generated

- **Users**: 1 admin, 5 teachers, 10 students
- **Pages**: 3 essential pages + 5 sample pages
- **News Categories**: 5 categories
- **News**: 18 published + 5 draft articles
- **Competencies**: 7 programs (4 main + 3 sample)
- **Gallery Albums**: 7 albums with 40+ items
- **PPDB Settings**: 1 active registration period
- **PPDB Registrations**: 17 registrations (10 pending, 5 verified, 2 rejected)

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 12.2**: Database migrations create all necessary tables
✅ **Requirement 12.3**: Seeders populate initial admin user and sample content
✅ **Testing Strategy from Design**: Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Unit tests for all models
  - Feature tests for authentication and CRUD operations
  - Integration tests for database interactions
  - Test data management with factories

## Notes

1. All tests use SQLite in-memory database for fast execution
2. Factories use realistic fake data via Faker library
3. Tests follow Laravel best practices and conventions
4. All models have proper relationships and scopes tested
5. Authorization and authentication flows fully tested
6. Sample data is realistic and suitable for demonstration purposes

## Next Steps

The implementation plan is now complete! All 14 main tasks and their subtasks have been successfully implemented. The application is ready for:
- Development testing with seeded data
- Automated testing with the comprehensive test suite
- Deployment following the documentation in SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md
