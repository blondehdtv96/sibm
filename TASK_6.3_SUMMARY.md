# Task 6.3: Create Public News Display Pages - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This task implements the public-facing news display functionality, including a news listing page with filtering, search, and pagination, as well as individual news article pages with related content.

Implementation:
- News listing page displays published news sorted by publication date (latest first)

### Requirement 3.5
✅ **WHEN an admin deletes news THEN the system SHALL remove associated images and database records**

Implementation:
- Already implemented in `Admin\NewsController::destroy()` method
